## Welcome to my profile üëã

* Here you're going to find out some repos that I've made to improve my knowledge like personal projects and college stuff.
* Below I have listed some techlogies that I use every day and others that I already worked with, so I learned a bit.
<br>

## About me
* I've started my career taking 1 year to study, by doing courses on Alura's platform. This time gaves me almost my whole knowledge until today, because I was able to conclude about 55 certified courses involving programming languages.
* I've learned about PHP, Laravel, MySQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap and started to work for my father, by making a system to him... to make his job easier.
* After working with him for about 2-3 years, I got my current job at Sispro Servi√ßos e Tecnologia S/A (Canoas) as an intern. There, I began my new journey with new programming languages (listed on Daily usage below).
* Last but not least, when I completted 9 months, I became Junior Software Developer.
<br>

## What am I doing currently? üóíÔ∏èüíª
* I'm on 7th semester of Computer Science at Universidade La Salle (Canoas);
* I work at Sispro Servi√ßos e Tecnologia S/A (Canoas) as a Junior Software Developer, dealing with migration code part from VB6 to C# and Angular;
* Improving my GIT knowledge;
* Exploring technologies I haven't seen yet like Java, Spring Boot, non-relational databases like MongoDB, React Native to create my app;
